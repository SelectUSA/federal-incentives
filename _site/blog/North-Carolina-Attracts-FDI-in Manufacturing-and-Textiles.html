<p><img src="https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/action/svg/design/ic_home_24px.svg" alt="Source" title="Source" /> <em>This post originally appeared on the <a href="/blog/North-Carolina-Attracts-FDI-in Manufacturing-and-Textiles.html">International Trade Administration blog</a>.</em></p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, I delivered remarks in Hilderbran, North Carolina at a ribbon-cutting ceremony where we officially opened the new Canadian-based Peds<sup>® </sup>Legwear (PEDS) production facility. PEDS’ recent $16 million investment in the plant and new machinery has allowed the company to hire North Carolina factory workers who were previously laid off. By 2018, this new facility will bring more than 200 jobs to Hildebran, providing a lift to the local economy.</p>

<p>SelectUSA, our program to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), along with our Commercial Service Canada team, helped facilitate this deal. SelectUSA provided counseling to PEDS on how to navigate the federal regulatory process and also helped identify sources of federal funding. In addition to PEDS’ investment in the Hildebran facility, the company plans an additional $8 million venture, bringing their total investment in the United States to $24 million. In less than two weeks, similar FDI deals will be highlighted at this year’s <a href="http://www.selectusasummit.com/">SelectUSA Investment Summit</a>, which will take place March 23-24.</p>

<p>In addition to ITA’s support, PEDS’ new investment is made possible because of a multi-year purchase order contract from Wal-Mart as part of the retailer’s commitment to buy domestically produced goods.</p>

<p>As I noted in <a href="http://trade.gov/press/speeches/2015/selig-031115.asp">my remarks</a>—before an audience that included Michael Penner, president and CEO of Peds<sup>® </sup>Legwear; Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart’s vice president of U.S. manufacturing; and North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory—PEDS’ investment in the facility shows our nation’s prowess to attract FDI.</p>

<p>Because the United States offers a transparent, fair, and stable business climate, as well as our second-to-none workforce, many global companies like PEDS are beginning to establish or expand operations here. In fact, in 2013, U.S. FDI inflows totaled $231 billion, of which $51 million was invested in U.S. textile and apparel manufacturing. In 2012, majority-owned U.S. affiliates of foreign firms accounted for $48 billion in R&amp;D expenditures, exported $334 billion worth of U.S. goods exports, and employed nearly 6 million workers.</p>

<p>To keep the momentum, ITA will continue to develop opportunities for U.S. workers and businesses by promoting international trade, encouraging FDI, and working to foster a level playing field for American products and services.</p>
